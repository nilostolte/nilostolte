## Introduction

Citizen of Canada and France, I am creative, autonomous, experienced, self-motivated, and after an entire career of software engineer, researcher in Computer Science, and university professor, having extensive experience in C++ and Java programming (desktop and Android), in enterprise management, and in research, I am nowadays focusing in improving graphics user interfaces (GUIs) using vector graphics in Java desktop applications as well as in Android, with impressive results in appearance, performance and display independence.

### Vector graphics as a portable solution for GUIs

Since vector graphics paths are very high level abstractions, although able to define complex low level shapes, they can also be seen as part of a generic metalanguage which is platform, operating system and language independent. In other words, one can define GUIs using vector graphics primitives which are at the same time efficient (since we are actually dealing with the lowest level layer of vector graphics pipeline) and portable, since these primitives are practically universal, having only tiny differences between different languages and platforms. 
This means that it is theoretically very easy to port a vector graphics GUI from one language to another, or from a platform to another, or an operating system to another. Not only that but the automatization of this trasnformations is not at all rocket science and actually not very complex. These transcompilers, though, may be quite labor intensive depending on the level of details of their implementation.

### Graphics designers as vector graphics GUI creators.

The main advantage of using vector graphics primitives for GUI contruction on the other hand, are neither one cited above. The actual quite important consequence of such choice is to be able to use graphics designers vector graphics art to define the GUI shapes and their effects. For a long time GUIs were exclusively designed by programmers, not artists, and had terrible appearences and no appeal. Not only that but frameworks for GUI construction, which are basically designed by programmers, are extremely standardized, difficult to customized and complex to learn and use. With the possibility to use artwork from graphics design this whole perspective radically changes. 
In addition to that graphics designers are much cheaper and more creative than programmers. It looks obvious that vector graphics is definitely the solution for modern and fancy GUIs.

### Future high resolution screens

But these are not the only advantages of using vector graphics for GUI creation. Its known intrinsic characteristic is of being insensitive to the resolution of the screen. One can for example zoom the whole interface without any lost of quality. This not only means that one can design far different GUIs having zooming as part of its interactive process but also that the same interface can run in a variety of different screen resolutions. With the advent of 4K and 8K monitors and panels this is a fundamental feature for the portability of the same interface in different screen resolutions. With 
screen technology growing faster than the hardware to display the information, vector graphics can be seen as the graal for solving this kind of problem. What's amazing is that barely no one is using it nowadays, and we will eventually have a problem where all applications will need to migrate to vector GUIs anyway.
