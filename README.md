## Introduction

Citizen of Canada and France, I am creative, autonomous, experienced, self-motivated, and after an entire career of **software engineer**, **researcher in Computer Science**, and **university professor**, having extensive experience in **C++** and **Java** programming (desktop and Android), in enterprise management, and in research, I am nowadays focusing in innovative graphics user interfaces (GUIs) using **vector graphics** in Java desktop applications as well as in Android, now using [HTML 5 Canvas with Javascript](https://nilostolte.github.io/) and other languages, with impressive results in appearance, performance and display independence. This work has a tremendous reach in terms of longevity as well as in reduction of costs of graphics user interfaces. <a name="vg_guis_html_anchor"></a>The vector graphics paradigm is almost universal and has been available in some languages and it has been recently migrating to hardware in the form of standard APIs.<br>

### Vector graphics as a portable solution for GUIs

Since [vector graphics paths](https://github.com/nilostolte/ClockWidget/blob/main/README.md#path-commands) are very high level abstractions, although able to define complex low level shapes, they can also be seen as part of a **generic metalanguage** which is platform, operating system and language independent. In other words, one can define GUIs using vector graphics primitives which are at the same time efficient (since we are actually dealing with the lowest level layer of vector graphics pipeline) and portable, since these primitives are practically universal, having only tiny differences between different languages and platforms. 
This means that it is very easy to port a vector graphics GUI from one language to another, or from a platform to another, or an operating system to another. Not only that but the automatization of this trasnformations is not at all rocket science and actually not very complex. <a name="graphics_designers_html_anchor"></a>These **transcompilers**, though, may be quite labor intensive depending on the level of details of their implementation.

### Graphics designers as vector graphics GUI creators.

The main advantage of using vector graphics primitives for GUI contruction on the other hand, are neither one cited above. The actual quite important consequence of such choice is to be able to use vector graphics art conceaved by **graphics designers** to define the GUI shapes and their appearence. For a long time GUIs were exclusively designed by programmers, not artists, and had terrible appearences and no appeal. Not only that but **frameworks** for GUI construction, which are basically designed by programmers, are extremely standardized, difficult to be customized and complex to learn and use. With the possibility to use **artwork from graphics designers** this whole perspective radically changes. In addition to that graphics designers are much cheaper and more creative than programmers. <a name="hd_screens_html_anchor"></a>It looks obvious that vector graphics is definitely the solution for modern and fancy GUIs.

### Future high resolution screens

But these are not the only advantages of using vector graphics for GUI creation. Its known intrinsic characteristic is of being **insensitive to the screen resolution**. One can for example zoom any part of the interface [without any loss of quality](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/%CF%80%20Vector%20GUI%20for%20Java%20and%20Android.md#basic-definitions). This not only means that one can design far different GUIs having **zooming** as part of its interactive process but also that the same interface can run in a variety of different screen resolutions. With the advent of **4K** and **8K** monitors and panels, and maybe even higher resolutions in the future, this is a fundamental feature for the **portability** of the same interface in different screen resolutions. With screen technology growing faster than the hardware to display the information, vector graphics can be seen as the graal for solving this kind of problem. <a name="dart_flutter_html_anchor"></a>What's amazing is that barely no one is using it nowadays, and we will eventually have a problem where all applications will need to migrate to vector GUIs anyway.

### Google did it: Dart and Flutter

Not everybody ignored all the vector graphics advantages in GUI contruction. **Google** didn't. That's the reason Google created **Flutter** and the language **Dart**. Dart can be seen as an enhanced revamped version of a vector graphics programming language and Flutter is its graphics environment. Dart and Flutter seem to be the solution for constructing GUIs and GUI-based appplications. Despite its growing popularity, **Dart and Flutter have caveats**. The main one is the fact of that they return the creative aspect back to programmers. As we have seen previously that is a mistake. Only a small amount of graphics designers would be interested in doing **design and programming**, and few will have both skills at reasonable level. In average one side could be good but the other sacrified. We have already forced artists to learn vector graphics production. Even though interactive tools make this task easier to them, artists had to adapt to all idiosyncrasies of vector graphics, particularly using **Bezier curves**. All mathematical aspects of Bezier curves are hidden to them, but some practical aspects are often missed, like setting control points touching the curve in minimal and maximal points. 
These aspects come as an **option**, and they generally only improve with the experience. But now Google is trying to convince artists that **programming is easy**. We have already seen this before with web programming and **JavaScript**. Artists had already a hard time to adapt to **Illustrator**, but now we are telling them to go a step further and submit to a totally **abstract way** of producing their art.

But it is also possible that Google is just another victim falling in the **trap of imposing a framework** desguised behind a language instead of offering a complete vector graphics language, or offering both side by side. The declarative nature of Dart doesn't actually promote the use of vector graphics primitives. The whole **marketing** behind Flutter seems to actually hide that and rather stress how easy it is to produce applications. Therefore the whole thing seems rather just like a framework. 
We have already seen that frameworks are **complex** as well as **difficult to customize** and to learn. Thus, the intention here seems to be not only to hide vector graphics primitives but also to hide the limitations of an underlying framework-like environment. Maybe the intention is to integrate in the language new ways to do interfaces as they appear. <a name="flutter_skia_html_anchor"></a>But if they can't appear in Dart we are assuming it is appearing somewhere else and this means that it is maybe an approach of staying one step behind, never being a vector of change.

### Flutter is just Skia disguised behind the scenes. Could Dart survive?

What is behind Flutter is **Skia**, a vector graphics library for **C++**. It is a quite complex and heavy library but it can be seen as a very good alternative for building vector graphics GUIs in C++ instead of **Qt**, since Qt is just a framework. This bring us to the fundamental limitation of Flutter and Dart for this score. It is designed to generate **machine language**, not **high level** and **portable** building blocks like vector graphics primitives.

This also brings us to the ultimate conclusion that there is probably no way to escape from **vector graphics primitives** to produce applications that have really portable GUIs. Does that mean that **Dart is a dead end?** Not necessarily. We know Flutter and Dart are **open source**. If Dart doesn't limit any vector graphics primitives for being accessed directly there is a chance to shortcircuit the compiler to accept only these constructions and to use it as a transcompiler. If it does limit them, direct access to these primitives must be added, but a new language would be created, since it is not actually Dart. In this way, in the case of a compiled language the normal compilation would take place to generate machine language. <a name="vectweb_html_anchor"></a>In the case one wishes to use a language having acces to its own vector graphics primitives, the compiler would generate high level code in that language, thus totally bypassing Skia.

### The problem of vector graphics on the web

Vector graphics on the web exists for a very long time with **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics). SVG, however, is approriate for static designs but not for active and live features such as in animations and widgets. The problem is that it is not efficient enough for real time interactivity. But there is a recent solution nowadays, and I explain that at the [end of this section](https://github.com/nilostolte#html5_html_anchor).

Besides active and live contents we also have problems with **fonts** on the web. Even if the problem of vector fonts is solved as we can see below, <a name="typoweb_html_anchor"></a>it is the structure and the rendering of html itself that became a problem, as far as zooming capabilities are concerned.

#### The problem of typography on the web

There is no better example of how **typography** performs badly on the web than this video from Kevin Powell about "responsive typography" on the web:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs9uJ7I4a70">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/158063377-7dcceb74-6909-4a0b-9bce-1653bf12e67b.png" width="683" height="384" >
</a><br><br>

What is really wrong there? What's wrong is that when one modifies the size of the window the text never scales properly. What they use to try to paliate the problem is a complex animation based scale change of fonts to make it appear similar to actually scaling the page, but that is obviously not what is happening there. Why not scaling the page entirely? Because it requires vector graphics and in the web nowadays it is not enoughly "responsive".

I have seen claims that what **Typetura** is aiming is size-specific adjustments to type designs as proposed by Tim Ahrens and Shoko Mugikura in ["Size-specific adjustments to type designs ‚Äì An investigation of the principles guiding the design of optical sizes"](https://justanotherfoundry.com/size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs). In this proposal the _shapes_ of the glyphs change with the scale as it has been observed in typography for many centuries and thanks to new psychological research in this subject. Here it is an example of how a metal typography font would change according to the scale:

<p >
<img = src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/163443530-68295ed5-b39b-4ad5-9aa3-f9338d3a37c9.png" width="70%" height="70%"><br>
<i>ATF Garamond, from left to right: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 72 pt</i>
</p>

If there is a future of **typography** on the web or in electronic typography in general, this would be it for sure. But this is not what Typetura is doing. Typetura is merely scaling fonts and not changing their shapes according to the scale as proposed by Tim Ahrens and Shoko Mugikura. In other words, what Typetura is actually doing is just trying to adapt WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) to the web as it is now.

However, one can easily see that what you get with the solution in the video is not what you want to see. The solution is a real responsive WYSIWYG experience that scales the text as one increases and decreases the size of the window, that is, actually scaling the whole contents according to the size of the window. This can only be obtained by rendering the window contents as vector graphics that are very easily scalable.

The solution is maybe through an open source library offering to render vector graphics in WebAssembly. Why open source? Because although WebAssembly is very powerful it is also very dangerous because it can convey malicious code without the user noticing. <a name="vaadin_html_anchor"></a>When a software is open source it is scrutinized by programmers who will identify malicious code if it exists.

#### Vaadin - How to not use Java on the web

Vaadin is a tentative to use **Java** on web programming but unfortunately in the wrong way. Vaadin actually tries to imitate UI frameworks such as the one found in Android or Java Core for desktop, but forgetting the most important stuff: `awt` JRE libraries and vector graphics primitives. In the video below one can clearly see how Vadiin is not the solution for Java UI on the web, because of its very obscure API and framework oriented structure:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGSDz-_dNhI">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/158072042-3b265bda-9db5-456a-9c08-6353bb7e1fc4.png" width="683" height="384">
</a><br><a name="figma_html_anchor"></a><br>

The problem with Vaadin is that exactly the framework aspect is what should be thrown away.

#### Figma - The Ultimate Solution

**Figma** is definitely the ultimate solution of vector graphics for the web and the future of GUI/UI on the web is in this kind of solution. Although Figma is very good, their solution is quite expensive, because it offers not only an integrated environment for vector graphics production but also to manage and integrate different designs to construct a whole application without programming.

Nonetheless, Figma's approach is very similar to what I propose, with the difference that Figma allows you to build designs over the web, making it ideal for working in groups, particularly remotely. Although there are a few points where I disagree with Figma's philosophy, I almost entirely agree with it. I believe that designing for the web is a fantastic idea. Figma, on the other hand, does not fully integrate the design into a programming context. The benefit of directly generating code is that it may be readily incorporated and reused in a variety of environments, including the web in WebAssembly. 

<a name="learnfromfigma_html_anchor"></a>Security difficulties arise from the use of WebAssembly in closed environments like Figma, because no one knows what a WebAssembly function is doing. Open source programming is the answer to this problem. However, because Figma is not open source, this will be impossible to achieve.

#### What can we learn from Figma?

Figma, on the other hand, gives us a great deal of useful information. We can benefit from their expertise because we'll already know which points don't work and which do. Here are some of their [conclusions](https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/#rendering):

> * _HTML and SVG contain a lot of baggage and are often much slower than the 2D canvas API due to DOM access. These are usually optimized for scrolling, not zooming, and geometry is often re-tessellated after every scale change._
> * _There is no guarantee about GPU acceleration and many things are still rendered on the CPU, which can be quite slow in certain cases._
> * _Support for masking, blurring, and blend modes in HTML and SVG varies wildly between browsers and is often not anti-aliased or is too low resolution on high-DPI displays._
> * _The 2D canvas API is an immediate mode API instead of a retained mode API so all geometry has to be re-uploaded to the graphics card every frame. This is needlessly wasteful and can become a bottleneck._
> * _Text layout is inconsistent between browsers and is even inconsistent between the same browser on different platforms._
> * _We wanted to be able to add features such as angular gradients which are not supported by any of these rendering APIs._

We resonate a lot with these conclusions and these are points we have already explicitly or implicitly evoked here. But their analysis coincide even more with my observations and longly spoken about in many repositories here:

> * _Our biggest pain point is lack of access to glyph outlines and kerning tables which there currently isn‚Äôt any way of getting at. One of the primary concerns is fingerprinting, but that battle has already been lost. We‚Äôre hoping access to font data can be exposed behind a user permission prompt like other privacy-sensitive APIs. Chrome has come up with a proposal for a fix that‚Äôs currently in the works (they‚Äôve been really helpful!) but there‚Äôs nothing else on the horizon for other browsers._

I have solved this problem by using fonts directly and reading all the needed information using [OpenType.js](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/Automatic%20Vector%20Fonts%20Generator%20Project.md#automatic-vector-fonts-generator-project--glyphs-their-widths-and-kerning-pairs) and by developing my own [right justification of texts](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/BreakIntoLines.md#breakintolines-project). In other words I implemented my own font rendering engine.
The inconvenient is that the selection of texts must be also handled internally as it is done in PDF viewers and that the text is not searchable, which is a classical problem PDF documents also have. But our goal is not to be searchable but to be portable across every platfrom, including the web.

> * _We would love to add support for common clipboard formats (.ai, .pdf, etc.) but the web has no way to do this. The only formats in the spec are text/plain and text/html (our Figma clipboard ‚Äúformat‚Äù is text/html with binary data encoded in an HTML comment)._

This is a very clever idea of copying a portion of the screen and pasting as text and html with binary content in HTML comments.

<a name="html5_html_anchor"></a>
Many other ideas of the difficulties found and several solutions are also mentioned in [this original document](https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web).

#### HTML 5 Canvas Vector Graphics API

This API is significantly faster than SVG and it allows (with some clever workaround) to have efficient as well as scalable live vector designs. Some people claim that `Canvas` is a bitmap feature and not really vectorial. This is not entirely correct. `Canvas` itself is a bitmap representation, but the vector graphics API allows building scalable graphics by just increasing the size of the `Canvas` dynamically in the cases when the scale changes. `Canvas` is a fairly recent addition to W3C standards and it is what allows games to be able to be ported for the web as we have been seeing.

But games are not the only applications that can be done with it. One can also code a whole web application using `Canvas` and vector graphics API. Even though very powerful, this API is not a panacea. I have found limitations that restrict its use for very complex and more professional applications. For example, clipping doesn't work properly if used more than once. What is missing is a library offering operations to join, subtract and intersect vector objects to generate more complex objects, such as the ones found in Java's awt `Area`. These operations can also be found in many vector graphics editors such as Illustrator and Inkscape.

Figma is using such a library, probably in WebAssembly. One of the problems with Figma is that it is a closed environment as cited previously. But such a library as an open source project would not only allow free and general use of these features but also solve any security issues concerning the code since its source code anybody can see.  <a name="VGUIeverywhere_html_anchor"></a>In an industrial environment these libraries can be modified for specific use. For example, the internal representation of objects could be different to avoid having their designs stolen.

### Vector GUI Everywhere

As we can see, what is proposed here is a coherent and portable way of building GUIs based on code that can be used everywhere including (and particularly) on the web. The best language to code completely portable interfaces according to nowadays availability of WebAssembly compilers as well as vector graphics support is probably **Go**. This still has to be demonstrated, but Figma is enough proof that this concept works.

The idea of using **Go** is that the same interface that can be compiled to a particular machine code (to be used in a desktop or mobile) can also be compiled to WebAssembly to be used on the web with only very small changes. The simplicity of **Go** and the ability to perform custom memory management also helps a lot in terms of portability and performance.

It is also possible to use Java but its use and compilation to WebAssembly is not as straighforward nowadays as with **Go**, which seems to be the ideal language to build interfaces in the near future. Of course that with the generalization of WebAssembly also to desktop and mobiles, any language could be used but rare are the languages having the vector graphics support of **Go** language. **Go** is maybe here to stay if one thinks about vector GUIs everywhere.<a name="activities_html_anchor"></a>

This version is a desktop version that is a much more flexible application, not only integrating new features such as complex numbers, parenthesis prioritized operations, new computation calculus libraries, copy-pasting of values, etc., but it also implements a GUI entirely based on vector graphics primitives (previously it used a homemade framework library of widgets as explained [here](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/%CF%80%20Vector%20GUI%20for%20Java%20and%20Android.md#origins-of-the-system)), uses a much 
more flexible and extensible approach for function implementations using lambda expressions, variable sized and zoomable window,etc. This application is going to be offered as an open source software on GitHub once it is completed. The main idea is to use it as a demo for vector graphics GUI.<a name="future_activities_html_anchor"></a>

### We‚Äôre not prepared for the end of Moore‚Äôs Law

[This report](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/02/24/905789/were-not-prepared-for-the-end-of-moores-law/?utm_source=LinkedIn&utm_campaign=site_visitor.unpaid.engagement&utm_medium=tr_social) from David Rotman (MIT) is very interesting. Retracing Moore's law, he exposes the new tendency of nowadays chip technology of not following this "law" (which is more a self-fulfilling prophecy than anything else) anymore. It is all a matter of investments and investment returns and chip manufactories not willing to take risks.

Even though largely declared as dead in the media and by the obvious stagnation of chip's technology growth in the last decade, Moore's law seems still alive thanks to 3D chip manufactury, new transistor designs (particularly vertically build as recently announced by IBM), as well as multi-core architectures that have only started to be exploited.

Here it is an excerpt:

> _Neil Thompson is an economist, but his office is at CSAIL, MIT‚Äôs sprawling AI and computer center, surrounded by roboticists and computer scientists, including his collaborator Leiserson. In a new paper, the two document **ample room for improving computational performance through better software, algorithms, and specialized chip architecture**._

> _One opportunity is in slimming down so-called software bloat to wring the most out of existing chips. When chips could always be counted on to get faster and more powerful, programmers didn‚Äôt need to worry much about writing more efficient code. And they **often failed to take full advantage of changes in hardware architecture, such as the multiple cores, or processors, seen in chips used today**._

> _Thompson and his colleagues showed that they could get a computationally intensive calculation to run some 47 times faster just by switching from Python, a popular general-purpose programming language, to the more efficient C. That‚Äôs because C, while it requires more work from the programmer, greatly reduces the required number of operations, making a program run much faster. Further tailoring the code **to take full advantage of a chip with 18 processing cores sped things up even more. In just 0.41 seconds, the researchers got a result that took seven hours with Python code**._

> _That sounds like good news for continuing progress, but Thompson worries it also signals **the decline of computers as a general purpose technology**. Rather than ‚Äúlifting all boats,‚Äù as Moore‚Äôs Law has, by offering ever faster and cheaper chips that were universally available, <a name="hints_html_anchor"></a>**advances in software and specialized architecture** will now start to selectively target specific problems and business opportunities, favoring those with sufficient money and resources._

### Classification in GUIs and 2D graphics

Useful to enhance picking time (O(log N)) in an unstructured GUI. Binary partition, aka BSP, is the easiest to implement. Using three borders is good to quickly discard empty regions as well (as clearly seen in the picture). One can also partition space regularly in a low resolution grid where each position contains a list of the objects within its borders for a potentially constant time picking in the case no synonyms exist (good for sparcely distrinuted objects).

### Java SIMD Vector API supports ARM SVE!

[OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/417) announced that platform agnostic API for SIMD instructions supports ARM SVE!

This [example illustrates](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/417) how this works:

```Java
static final VectorSpecies<Float> SPECIES = FloatVector.SPECIES_PREFERRED;

void vectorComputation(float[] a, float[] b, float[] c) {
    int i = 0;
    int upperBound = SPECIES.loopBound(a.length);
    for (; i < upperBound; i += SPECIES.length()) {
        // FloatVector va, vb, vc;
        var va = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, i);
        var vb = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, i);
        var vc = va.mul(va)
                   .add(vb.mul(vb))
                   .neg();
        vc.intoArray(c, i);
    }
    for (; i < a.length; i++) {
        c[i] = (a[i] * a[i] + b[i] * b[i]) * -1.0f;
    }
}
```

### Java `Graphics2D`: you don't need double buffering 

If you are into Java programming this might sound to you as a big surprise and almost as a huge heresy. No, you just don't need a `JPanel` and you definitely don't need double buffering.

What you need is just a `JFrame` and buffering with a `BufferedImage`, where you save your `Graphics2D` using `createImage`. You then use `drawImage` to display the saved buffer whenever you need to refresh the whole `JFrame`. Never redisplay your whole `JFrame` with `Graphics2D` primitives, but only with the `BufferedImage`. You can redisplay only parts of the `JFrame`. In this case your `JFrame` "paint" method must know what part to update by selective painting (like highlighting a button when clicked).

This is far much faster than double buffering and you will never see any flickering. Thus you will have the best performance with the same result as using a `JPanel` and double buffering.

But that is not the only advantage. It also allows easily zooming your entire window (by using `setSize` method) because you are dealing with the `JFrame` directly. Every time your window changes size (for example, by clicking on a magnifier lens with "+" or "-" icon) you create a new `BufferedImage` for the redisplay. This concept is a desirable feature when you are dealing with vector graphics interfaces (basically using `Shape` and `Graphics2D`), as zooming can become part of the interface.

It might sound weird to talk about vector graphics and a pixelized `BufferedImage` at the same time. However, a `Shape` is first scan-converted before being displayed. By using a buffer you are just anticipating and cutting down scan-conversion time. This is extremely useful in complex vector graphics interfaces. It is a know fact that what is deterring the generalized use of vector graphics in GUIs, either in embedded applications, either on the web, is that it is quite time consuming.

This will likely change in the near future when hyper high resolution screens will appear and programs will have to deal with a wide range of screen resolutions. Vector graphics will then be the most elegant solution to this problem. <a name="utf8_html_anchor"></a>Using lots of photos and images in your web sites? If they are only for decoration you will probably be in trouble when this arrives. 


### UTF-8 the ultimate standard for UNICODE texts

[This project](https://github.com/nilostolte/UTF-8) allows to read UTF-8 encoded UNICODE files. It implements an infinite buffer file reader where one can recover the text word by word, which is converted from UTF-8, skipping blanks. The blanks can be recovered since they are all counted (feature used in the test program). By skipping blanks the reader is able to identify the start and the end of the words because they are different than blank. The fact that the text is encoded is totally transparent to the reader. The test program reads an UTF-8 testing file and prints it over the console. A batch file is provided to help running the jar. The source files are also given and they are all for free with no license of any kind. <a name="art_html_anchor"></a>
