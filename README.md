## Introduction
Citizen of Canada and France, I am creative, autonomous, experienced, self-motivated, and after an entire career of software engineer, researcher in Computer Science, and university professor, having extensive experience in C++ and Java programming (desktop and Android), in enterprise management, and in research, I am nowadays focusing in improving graphics user interfaces (GUIs) using vector graphics in Java desktop applications as well as in Android, with impressive results in appearance, performance and display independence.
### Vector graphics as a portable solution for GUIs
Since vector graphics paths are very high level abstractions, although able to define complex low level shapes, they can also be seen as part of a generic metalanguage which is platform, operating system and language independent. In other words, one can define GUIs using vector graphics primitives which are at the same time efficient (since we are actually dealing with the lowest level layer of vector graphics pipeline) and portable, since these primitives are practically universal, having only tiny differences between different languages and platforms. 
This means that it is theoretically very easy to port a vector graphics GUI from one language to another, or from a platform to another, or an operating system to another. Not only that but the automatization of this trasnformations is not at all rocket science and actually not very complex. These transcompilers, though, may be quite labor intensive depending on the level of details of their implementation.
### Graphics designers as vector graphics GUI creators.
The main advantage of using vector graphics primitives for GUI contruction on the other hand, are neither one of the above cited. The actual quite important consequence of such choice
